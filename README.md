# Django_Notes
This file will cover the Django Notes.<br>
* First file to be checked is [Django.md](/Django.md)
* If you're interested with User Authentication then check [DjangoAA.md](/DjangoAA.md)
* NGINX - uWSGI - DJANGO implementation is written inside the [Django_Nginx.md](/Django_Nginx.md)
* Asynchronous Task and Websocket implementation for Django will be covered inside the [Django_Async_Task](/Django_Async_Task.md)
* Asynchonous Tasks Uses Redis technology at backend. Both websocket (via channels) and asynchronous tasks (via celery). There is an alternatif for asynchonous tasks, however, I couldn't find an alternatif way to do it in websocket. That's why, it's good idea to look Redis as well in document [Redis.md](/Redis.md)
* The RestAPI file will be covered in [DjangoRestAPI.md](/DjangoRestAPI.md)
* Django Implementation with Vue is documented inside the [Django_Vue.md](/Django_Vue.md)

Any further topic could be added will be considered later on. Feel free to make your own research. If you plan to share this repository, do not forgot the give credit.
